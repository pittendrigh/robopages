# robopages
Hierarchical files based rapid application no-database CMS without layout or complexity limitations

<h1> Robopages Big Picture </h1>

Robopages was developed as a rapid application way to make complex online documentation for online instructional classes. Robopages makes it possible to quickly assemble and continuously edit a complex system of pages with minimal effort. Any layout is possible. Robopages can be used as the framework for websites of arbitrary complexity. 
<br/><br/>
For developers, rapid application is good no matter what. Robopages websites that do not use a database are fast to make and fast to run.  So they can be left as is--and they can be expected to scale well too. But some developers might want to use Robopages as fast way to hack out a new layout. And then, once done, to export that newly developed content and layout to a more cumbersome system like Drupal or Wordpress.
<br/><br/>
The biggest missing features now are an embeddable forum and/or an embeddable shopping cart.  As it is now those features must be added as separate entities whose CSS does its best to make them look like an integral part of the enclosing Robopages site.  But that's a problem for most CMS software systems.   
<br/><br/>
Robopages, by default, uses a hierarchical directory system of HTML fragment files to create its contents. So you can edit content in place with a text editor or with shell scripts. You can continuously rearrange structure by moving files and directories up or down in the server-side file system.  Links can be generated statically from config files or on the fly--robotically. All content comes from plugin mechanisms which can be made to generate content however the developer wants--with or without a database for instance.
