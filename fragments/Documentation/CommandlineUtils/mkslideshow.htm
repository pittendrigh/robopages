<b> mkslideshow creates a slideshow but it does NOT create thumbnail links</b>
If you want thumbnail navigation links see <a href="?page=Documentation/mkthumbs.htm">mkthumbs.htm</a><br/>
<br/>


To run mkslideshow ssh into the server (or run it on localhost for development).  Cd to the directory where you want the slideshow.<br/>
type: <br/>
mkslideshow <enter> <br/>
    <br/>
    Note that mkslideshow, as written, requires sudo permission, so it runs on virtual dedicated servers where the apache installation is picky about file permissions.<br/>
