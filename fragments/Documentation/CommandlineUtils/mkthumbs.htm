<b>mkthumbs creates roboresources/thumbs roboresouces/pics and roboresources/slideshow</b><br/>
<br/>
The thumbnails come from a script-bottom call to another script named <b>picthumbs</b>. <br/>
For picthumbs you will need to install <b>Imagemagick</b> and various perl libraries including: <br/>
<b>Image::Size<br/>
    CWD<br/>
    File::Basename<br/>
    MIME::Types <br/> </b>
Use <b>sudo yum search/install</b> or <b>sudo apt-cache search/sudo apt-get install</b> or <b>sudo perl -MCPAN -eshell</b> to find and install the perl libraries above.

Installing picthumbs will be beyond the abilities of many beginning hackers.  I should make a point and click php utility that works on localhost, whose output could be copied up to the server.<br/>
