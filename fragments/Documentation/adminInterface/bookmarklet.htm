<h1> Edit this as needed </h1>

To start the admin interface point your brower at href="?layout-nerd" <br/>
That will start the AdminInteface at the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your website.<br/>
You can make a book mark to http://yoursite.com/?layout=nerd. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to can make it a little fancier with the following bookmarklet.<br/>
Turn this into a book mark in your toolbar. Then you will jump into the <br/>
AdminInterface starting at what ever content directory you browser was <br/>
was in when you clicked the toolbar icon. <br/>
<br/>
It's best not to have any publicly visible code to displayed on the <br/>
website pointing to any login screen.  When it's just an icon on inside <br/>
your browser you aren't asking hackers to to break in. ?layout=nerd is <br/>
better than ?page=login too.  <br/>



<h3> Edit the location.replace value below. Install it as a bookmarklet </h3>
<br/>
javascript:(function()<br/>
{<br/>
 var result = '',tmp = [];<br/>
 location.search.substr(1).split("&").forEach(<br/>
      function (item) <br/>
      {<br/>
        tmp = item.split("=");<br/>
        if (tmp[0] === 'robopage') <br/>
           result = decodeURIComponent(tmp[1]);<br/>
       });<br/>
  var where="?robopage=" + result + "&layout=nerd";<br/>
  window.location.replace("http://localhost/robopages/?robopage="+result+"&layout=nerd")<br/>
})()<br/>
