<h1> Admin Interface as of Tue Jan 22 16:31:12 MST 2019</h1>

This is a new feature not yet documented
The safest and best way to operate robopages is in a bash/scp only mode.
The site admin can chown -R all files to a user who is not the apache process
and chmod -R 555 the fragments directory, chmod or chown  any LOGS directories, in order make them writable to the web server process..
Then it's secure.
<br/><br/>

You might want to build a robopages site for a customer however, who doesn't do
bash perl python sed awk and scp.
<br/><br/>

In that case the RobopageAdmin.php interface is a work in progress.
I'm not making any promises as to it's security as of today.
I do have one user using it.
<br/><br/>

Once I get it cleaned up enough I'll spend some time working on security issues.
The various action="?layout=nerd" method="post" forms need to make more use of md5 tokens,etc.
Right now it works and it's safe because only one site in the universe uses it.  And no one else knows.
Better security will happen in time
<br/><br/>

To make this work you have to chown -R apache.apache the fragments directory.
You may have to chmod -R 555 too if it's on a virtual dedicated server.
<br/><br/>

The admin interface does a recursive chmod -R 755 to make it writable during the admin session.
If the user remembers to click the Logout button it chmods back to 555 when done.
<br/><br/>

Authentication is files based.  Look for RobopagePasswords.php in the plugins directory.
the RobopagePasswords.php file has the form usename:md5password:nimda, where nimda (admin backwards) 
is hard-coded.  
<br/><br/>
(test login as user: gitgit<br/>
 with password: gotgit)<br/>
gitgit:c7e0cc5ac1a953943a0b87422e5559e5:nimba<br/>
<br/>
Further documentation will follow eventually. Are there any users other than me?
I have a half a dozen robopages sites, now going on over a decade.
And I have the one amateur user who uses RobopageAdmin.php, and upload.php, edit.php, imgResize.php etc.
<br/><br/>

The upload mechanism is open source codes from Github.  I have not credited him yet. I will..
<br/><br/>

<h3> How to do it</h3>
got to the conf directory. copy RobopageAdminPlugins.ini onto plugins.ini<br.>
edit the plugins/RobopagePasswds.php file appropriately.<br.>
There is no "login" link in the codes. You have point a browser at the document root<br.>
and then manually add ?layout=nerd to see a login screen.<br.>
Click the logout button as you leave.<br.>
