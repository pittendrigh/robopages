<h1> Admin Interface as of Tue Jan 22 16:31:12 MST 2019</h1><br/>
<br/>
This is a new feature not yet documented<br/>
The safest and best way to operate robopages is in a bash/scp only mode.<br/>
The site admin can chown -R all files to a user who is not the apache process<br/>
and chmod -R 555 the fragments directory, chmod -R 777 any LOGS directories.<br/>
Then it's secure.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to build a robopages site for a customer however, who doesn't do<br/>
bash perl python sed awk and scp.<br/>
<br/>
In that case the RobopageAdmin.php interface is a work in progress.<br/>
I'm not making any promises as to it's security as of today.<br/>
I do have one user using it.<br/>
<br/>
Once I get it cleaned up enough I'll spend some time working on security issues.<br/>
<br/>
To make this work you have to chown -R apache.apache the fragments directory.<br/>
You may have to chmod -R 555 too if it's on a virtual dedicated server.<br/>
<br/>
The admin interface does a recursive chmod -R 755 to make it writable during the admin session.<br/>
If the user remembers to click the Logout button it chmods back to 555 when done.<br/>
<br/>
Authentication is files based.  Look for RobopagePasswords.php in the plugins directory.<br/>
the RobopagePasswords.php file has the form usename:md5password:nimda, where nimda (admin backwards) <br/>
is hard-coded. <br/> 
someuser:f265fbe0b5c26eb2716d3b168ea60614:nimba<br/>`
<br/>
Further documentation will follow eventually. Are there any users other than me?<br/>
I have a half a dozen robopages sites, now going on over a decade.<br/>
And I have the one amateur user who uses RobopageAdmin.php, and upload.php, edit.php, imgResize.php etc.<br/>
<br/>
The upload mechanism is open source codes from Github.  I have not credited him yet. I will..<br/>
<br/>
<h3> How to do it</h3>
got to the conf directory. copy RobopageAdminPlugins.ini onto plugins.ini<br.>
edit the plugins/RobopagePasswds.php file appropriately.<br.>
There is no "login" link in the codes. You have point a browser at the document root<br.>
and then manually add ?layout=nerd to see a login screen.<br.>
Click the logout button as you leave.<br.>
