<h1> A few more XML.xml layout details </h1>
<br/>
in an XML layout file if you had  a XML line like <b> &lt;div id="main-disp" src="flexyFileContent"/*gt; </b><br/>
That would been DIV element whose id was main-disp would display the output generated by plugins/flexyFileContent.php <br/>
Among other things that means that content would be encased in a black element named main-disp, probably styled
by CSS codes in css/robo.css
<br/><br/>

An XML layout might contain codes like this:<br/>
<pre>
<b>&lt;div id="main-disp" src="flexyFileContent" &gt; <br.>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div id="toc" src="dynamicNaviation" /&gt;/
&lt;/div&gt; </b> <br/>
</pre>
<br/>
The XML above places the output from plugins/dynamicNavigation.php inside the boundaries
of the block element DIV whose id is main-content.  But that also means
the content from dynamicNavigation is contained within a block element DIV (inside main-disp)
whose id is toc. <br/>
Block elements contained with block elements (toc inside main-disp) carry some layout baggage.
Perhaps what you really want is for the contents generated by both flexyFileContent.php AND dynamicNavigation.php
to be displayed inside main-disp, without a block element boundary around the content generated by dynamicNavigation.php 
<br/><br/>
To to that the src="" attribute can specify one or MORE plugins as content generators, as a comma-delimited value.<br/>
For Instance as: <br/>
<pre>
<b>&lt;div id="main-disp" src="flexyFileContent,dynamicNavigation" /&gt; </b><br.>
</pre>
In the exapmple above the output generated by dynamicNavigation might be a series of rectangles containing
thumbnail images and a bit of text, packaged as a hyperlink.  If all those small recatangle were told by CSS to 
float: left; that could be used a convenient gallery layout, where rectangular thumbnails surround a main display image.
