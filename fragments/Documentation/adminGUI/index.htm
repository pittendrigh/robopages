<h1> administrative GUI?</h1>

Robopages doesn't have a built in administrative GUI.  I spent a few months writing one several years ago and then abandoned the effort when I realized phpMyAdmin already did what I was doing.

In Robopages, if you are using the file.php dynamicNavigation.php and flexyFileContent.php plugins your webpages will automatically appear, if you copy the right HTML fragments and images up to the server (and place them somewhere in a hierarchical directory structure under the "fragments directory."  phpMyAdmin already does that.  Robopages is primarily a rapid application development tool fo unix-savvy developers who don't need a GUI.  But if you want one you can have it.

Use phpMyAdmin.
