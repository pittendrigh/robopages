<h1> plugins/roboBook.php </h1>
Not much documentation yet.  This works but somewhat painfully.<br/><br/>
Getting booknav to work currently relies on scripts in commandLineUtils<br/><br/>
Better documentation AND melding the setup for roboBook into the admin interface will happen.<br/>
to make a simple book put commandLineUtils/tocit.py into your ~/bin
cd to the top directory of an HTML source hierarchy you want to be treated as a book.<br/>
run: tocit.py  &lt;enter&gt; <br/>
now edit a line in conf/dirlayouts:
Library/Flies|roboBook
<br/><br/>
If you want a book to appear in fragments/Library/Flies <br/>
then create a folder hierarchy in fragments/Library/Flies<br/>
The top-level directories there will be treated as the chapters of a book.<br/>
Below those top-level chapters arbitray folder nesting is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Page sequencing necessary for the Next and Prev page buttons depends on a a fragments/Library/Flies/p2n file<br/>
You can generate such a file as follows:<br/>
copy commandLineUtils/tocit.py to your ~/bin directory<br/>
cd fragments/Library/Flies<br/>
run tocit.py *lt;enter&gt; <br/>
if the pages do not appear as expected inspect the p2n file<br/>
Each line should be the same as the $_GET parameter of ?robopage=Library/Flies/Dryflies/index.htm<br/>
<br/>
If the p2n file does not appear as needed you might try running tocit.py with a --prepath argument<br/>
Or edit p2n manually with vi<br/>
<br/>
If I stay healthy enough this will be cleaner in a week or so from today: 03/15/2020<br/>
