<h1> contactus </h1>

plugins/contactus.php is a primitive email form that could be specified with a link such as:
<br/> <br/>
?layout=contactus
<br/> <br/>
I'm including it here mostly as illustrative example. This script does not support any interactive replyTo feature the email recipient. Instead the user (the original email sender) is forced to supply his or her return email address in a form field. That return address is prepended to the message of the email, thereby making the script invulnerable to spammers--who might try to use end-of-line characters in the to field to trick the system's mail function into spamming multiple addresses.

This script could easily be modified to support the replyTo functionality.  I just don't want to take responsibility for it.  This script is here mostly as an example.
