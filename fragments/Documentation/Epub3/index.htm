<h3> Epub3 on the Server </h3>

You can now create epub3 (but not yet epub2) files with an editor like Sigil. Copy that file to somewhere under the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your server. Then edit conf/dirlayouts.ini and away it goes.<br/>
<br/>
Hyphothetical set of steps:<br/>
scp my.epub3 to your home directory on the server<br/>
ssh to the server.<br/>
<br/>
cd /var/www/html/myrobopages/conf<br/>
vi dirlayouts.ini<br/>
....make a line in dirlayouts.ini as follows:<br/>
Ebook|book<br/>
<br/>
cd /var/www/html/myrobopages/fragments<br/>
mkdir Ebook<br/>
cd Ebook<br/>
cp ~/my.epub3 .<br/>
unzip my.epub3<br/>
<br/>
The contents of my.epub3 should show up in your browser, complete with a table of contents.<br/>
The current TOC doesn't collapse into an icon and then expand back full size yet.  Perhaps eventually.<br/>
It works as it is and I have a lot going on. It's only a few lines of Javascript to make that happen.<br/>
