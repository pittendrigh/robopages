<h1>SEO and roboresources directories</h1>
<br/>
Robopages behavior revolves around two most used plugins:<br/>
dynamicNavigation.php and flexyFileContent.php<br/>
<br/>
You aren't required to use those plugins but they are useful. They are the heart and soul of robopages.<br/>
Inside the fragments directory the admin creates an arbitrarily complex hierarchy of directories.<br/>
<br/>
Those directories get populated with HTML fragment files (index.htm, boats.htm, whatever.htm) images<br/>
and other allowed files as recognized by defined in conf/roboMimeTypes.ini<br/>
<br/>
For each such nested content directory inside fragments the admin can create an optional roboresources directory.<br/>
....path/path/fragments/roboresources<br/>
<br/>
roboresources directories do not appear in dynamic navigation displays.  <br/>
roboresources typically contains a pics directory which contains either images or links to images, and a thumbs directory. Thumbnail images are expected to have a tn- prefix.  pics/boat.jpg would be matched with thumbs/tn-boat.jpg<br/>
<br/>
Creating those directories and resources with a GUI would require making the file system writable to the web server process. I prefer to do everything with ssh scp bash scripts and perl or python. mkslides is a perl script included with the sources.<br/>
<br/>
<h3> SEO Punchline </h3>
The roboresources directories can also include the files:<br/>
layout<br/>
title<br/>
keywords (applies to all files in the parent directory)<br/>
description (applies to all files in the parent directory)<br/>
page.htm-keywords (overrides keywords and for this particular page only)<br/>
page.htm-description (overrides description and for this particular page only)<br/>
<br/>
Those files are typically generated by a script and then manually edited to some degree, on either a per-directory or per-page basis.<br/>
