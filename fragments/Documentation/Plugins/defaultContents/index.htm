<h1> Default Contents </h1>

The file.php is the most commonly used plugin. Foreach block level element defined in any layout.xml file, such as:
<br/><br/>
&lt;div id="footer" src="file" /&gt;
<br/><br/>
...the system will use the plugins/file.php class to generate the footer's content.<br/>
For a page whose dynamic URL might be ?page=Driftboats/Beavertail/Online-Plans/index.htm the system will look for a file named footer.frag in the <b>fragments/Driftboats/Beavertail/Online-Plans</b> directory.  If that file is found the system will use the php file_get_contents function to supply the needed HTML fragment.  
<br/><br/>
However, if no such file is found the system will fall back on a "default contents" search, by looking in the <b>fragments/hidden </b>  directory for the footer's contents.  If that file is not found the system uses the null string '' for contents, rather than reporting an error.
<br/><br/>
So, in other words the developer can use the file.php plugin and file fragments in the <b>fragments/hidden</b> subdirectory for all repeated per-page boilerplate HTML.
