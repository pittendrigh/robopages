Most of robopages works reliably, particularly the combination of dynamicNavigation and flexyFileContent. I have used it on production sites for years.
Any and all previous work on dislaying epub3 on the server has
been abandoned in favor of this dynamic HTML book-like version.
This roboBook work, however, is not yet ready for prime time.
If you download robopages and give it a twirl, do not rely on roboBook just yet.
It is in active development now, as of 03/20/2020
<br/><br/>
So this too is development code only.  But it already works more reliably than the previous epub3 display. One big problem with server-side epub display are book by book conflicts between robopages CSS and CSS styling specified by the displayed book.  This sort of thing is a headache that has to be reworked for every new epub(3) you want to display. I'm abandoning it for now.
At some point I might try to figure out how to make my serever-side PHP codes ignore any CSS links specified in the epub.
Right now I'm far more interested in roboEpub.
Eventually it would be interesting to make a roboEpub to epub3 converter.
<br/><br/>
These codes display a table of contents showing all top-level book chapters, with arbitrary file-system directory/folder nesting below that, where local chapter-level links are added depending on which chapter is currently being viewed.

<br/><br/>
All this depends upon the existance of a Library/MybookName/p2n file, which can be generated with commandLineUtils/tocit.py
Once generated by tocit.py manual vi edits are fine.  tocit.py will preserve any manually edits.

The p2n file provides page by page sequencing for the Next and Previous page buttons in the TOC
