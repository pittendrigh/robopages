<p><h1> Introduction  -- Mar_4_2020</h1>
This is (the start of) an ebook about making flies and lures mostly but not entirely for Montana fishing.  I decided early on not to work with a traditional print technology publisher because I don’t want to be saddled with outside influences.  I want to do this my way. Mistakes and all.   I also want this book in server-side HTML  format because embedded video will be part of the final product.  <sup class="sup"><b><i>1</i></b></sup>  Paper and epub can't do video.

<br/><br/> 
I’ve been writing how-to-do-it boat building instructions for almost half a century now.  Good writing is great but even mediocre video is better than words only when showing someone how to actually make something. We'll see how this goes.  

<br/><br/>
<h2> Themes </h2>
I don't like to be constrained by anything, least of all self-inflicted rules.  So I will be gleefully inconsistent at times.  I don't like rules and those there are are made to be broken.  
<br/><br/>
However I do have two main top-level goals I try to follow.  <b>Utility</b> and <b>fast and easy to tie</b>, usually at the expense of pains taking, nit picking detail by detail imitation.  I will, in other words, almost always choose a dry fly that floats well and dries off quickly over a more complicated and fussy pattern that's harder to keep afloat.
<br/><br/>

<h3> Fast and Easy </h3>
Fast and easy to tie has long been a goal for me. For each bug or prey critter I'll try to imitate I’ll often have more than one version--each time—for each critter--as a sequence of designs presented from easiest and simplest to most complex and most time consuming to make. Fast and easy is good but it's not a rule. Complicated is fun too. Occassionally anyway.  

<br/><br/>   
The fast and easy theme is even more important for me now that I’m old and I can’t see much anymore. I can still tie but details are difficult. I use 5x jeweler’s magnifying goggles. Bad late-in-life eyesight isn't fun but it has turned out to have hidden rewards of sorts.  Adapting my tying to accommodate age turns out to be an interesting subject in in its own right, because so many of the changes I’ve made have merged seemlessly with my favorite minimalist, fast and easy design goals.  

<h3>Utility </h3>
<b>Easy to cast</b> is important and all too often overlooked too. Flies that tangle the leader aren’t worth much no matter what happens after they hit the water. I've had to abandon many an experimental line of tying because of wind-resistance and tangling.   

<br/><br/> 
For dry flies I like <b>floats well and dries off quickly </b>. CDC makes a beautiful dry fly but I don’t like spending time drying CDC flies off in between fish.  That trade off works for some but not for me. I like dry flies I can pick up off the water, snap cast once or twice and then put back down again, without hand drying, blowing, fluffing and re-dressing in between casts.   

<h3> Sinks Quickly </h3>
For wet flies and especially streamers I tend to like sparse flies that sink quickly.   

<h3>Match the Behavior </h3>
I do my best to match the critter.  I want mayfly patterns to look like mayflies and  crayfish to look like crayfish. But after all these years I doubt it matters much.  In the mean time a buzz phrase I’ve come to like is <b>Match the Behavior</b> rather than match the hatch.  I’ll get back to that later too. 

<h3> Organization </h3>
How to organize a book about Montana flies seems straightforward at first glance.  A Montana Flies book could be divided up into dry flies wet flies and streamers, perhaps  with a few subcategories like Mayflies, Attractors, Sculpins and Crayfish, etc.  

<br/><br/> 
But it gets complicated when you remember favorite fly choices vary by season, by fish species targeted and by which lake pond creek reservoir stream or river you use them in. I've decided to still go with a fly type by fly type organization.  I'll do my best to work seasonal and location variations in on the fly. 

<h3> Not just trout fishing </h3>
I started off fishing for bluegills and bass in New Jersey, as a kid, and then got diverted, for most of a lifetime, by Rocky Mountain trout streams. But I’ve since discovered bonefish, snappers, barracuda, sea trout, redfish, flounder, small mouth bass, pike and in some ways most interesting of all:
channel catfish. On the fly rod.  With flies.  I’m am not and never will be a
purist. About anything.  

<br/><br/>
