<h1> _Mar_3_2020 </h1>

These web pages used to be little more than a collection of fly photos. Now I'm working on a new Robopages<sup><b><i>I</i></b></sup> plugin so I can present these pages online in a more booklike fashion--complete with dynamic next and previous page buttons, so the website looks and works like an epub book displayed on a tablet or phone.  Most of it works now, as of this writing.  But it is still a bit buggy.
<br/><br/>
These pages will, in other words, gradually evolve into a book about Montana Flies.  Most of the flies here will be mine but I'll be presenting the work of others too, from work by fishing buddies of mine like Randy Berry and Willy Self, and whoever else I can corral.  
<br/><br/>
Deadlines and hard work aren't part of my retirement plan so this will evolve slowly. At its own pace.  I hope to make how-to-do-it video part of the deal too.  Perhaps even some how to build a boat video too?  We'll see.   Perhaps.  If I live that long. :=))
