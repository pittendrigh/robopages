<h1>Yellowstone River 1997</h1>  

It was scary. After weeks of dangerous flooding that nearly destroyed  the famous Paradise Valley spring creeks--the Yellowstone River was  finally starting to recede. The Yellowstone's  churning western-most bank   was still only 10' away from DePuy's Spring Creek. The old spawning channel   and about 20 acres of willow thickets were completely gone. The culverts at  the PHD pool and the Blue Gate were gone too, and so were the old swan  ponds. The roaring, chocolate brown river was so loud it was hard to  hear yourself think. 

<br/><br/>
Huge cottonwood logs would rise up vertically in  the center of the rivers's swiftest currents, shudder for a few  <img src="_ROBOPATH_roboresources/Hulagan.jpg" alt="Hulagan.jpg"  />  moments, and then splash down loudly like a sounding whale. Clanging  boulders at the bottom of the river sounded like the faint sounds of  dynamite explosions in a distant mine. And amidst all this, Pale  Morning Duns were hatching on the spring creek at noon, as if on cue.  I chatted with John Greene, an old friend and one of the best spring  creek guides in Montana. "You'll have to adjust," John said. "The weeds  are all washed out, and there are a lot of river fish in the creek now  too. We've been catching fish on Hare's Ears and Bitch Creeks: flies  that haven't worked here for years." The hatches are sparse too. It  will take another month or two for the weeds to grow back--before gets  back to normal."    
<br/><br/>

But the mid-day fishing turned out to be as good as ever. The PMD  hatch lasted until almost 3:00. Fishing to rising trout with tiny  yellow dry flies is something no fly fisherman's life should be  without. To catch these fish, you have to get it right. You need a thin  supple leader, a good-looking fly and a graceful presentation. When you  do get it right, the fishing is never better.  This is the classic  spring creek fishing that makes these waters what they are. But later  in the afternoon, when the hatch was done, I found fishing a lot more  difficult--at least at first try. The wafting, choking-thick spring  creek weeds hadn't yet grown back, since scouring out with the previous  week's flood; so good, safe holding spots were hard to come by. Once  the hatch was done, the fish seemed suddenly to have disappeared.    I tried midges, copper nymphs, caddis larvae and small olive woolly  buggers with limited success. It was time for a little imagination, it  seemed. I had some experimental, 1/2" long minnow-like wigglers I was  curious to try.  So I started working downstream, dead drifting my  wigglers at the start of each cast, until they caught the current and  wiggled down into ever deeper water at the heads of the riffles and  drop-offs. A threatening cloud cover moved in about 4:00 in the  afternoon. I started bumping a fish on almost every cast. I caught so  many fish I lost track. Before long all but one last wiggler was gone,  snagged and lost or chewed to oblivion by too many feisty spring creek  teeth.    
<br/><br/>

I stopped for a late afternoon snooze  on a soft mud bank near the  remains of one of the old swan ponds. I drove down to the main ranch  house to finish off the day on the lower mile or so of the creek. Below  the old foot bridge, just downstream of the main ranch house and across  the creek from the lambing sheds, there was a submerged, half rotten  cottonwood log that created a narrow tongue of fast white water. I cast  across stream and down, over the log an past the white water, to drift  my last remaining wiggler into some overhanging willow branches along  the bank. Tis spot would be virtually impossible to fish to from  anywhere other than directly upstream. I hooked a good brown on the  first cast. He thrashed his head twice and then came off  the hook. I  quickly stripped in my line, preparing for another cast. But the diving  bull caught the current a unexpectedly and planed quickly upstream,  right into the white water. The wiggler darted frantically back and  forth, vibrating wildly from side to side in the fast water. 
<br/><br/>

A big,  rainbow rose up vertically from below, right into the frothy, bubbly  millrace and clobbered the wiggler. It didn't make sense. I didn't  think a fish could live in such fast water. I released the big rainbow  and then repeated these moves again and again, bumping, catching,  releasing and losing perhaps a dozen or more fish in a half an hour,  all from a small triangular pocket of white water nor more than 4 feet  long. Gradually I realized that white water on top doesn't necessarily  mean fast water below. There must have been a deep still water pocket  directly underneath the faster stuff that held and incredible number of  fish.    This is why I find wiggler fishing so exciting: to my staple  repetoire of dry flies, emergers, nymphs and streamers--a repetoire  that hasn't changed much in quite a few years--I suddenly have a new  tool that magically creates new places to fish. When I tie on a new  wiggler, it's like donning a special pair of glasses that instantly  highlight heretofore off limits places.    
<br/><br/>

There is a more to it though, than just the ability to fish  downstream. There is something very special about a fly that wiggles and moves.   We fisherman aren't scientists. The fishing knowledge we have doesn't come  from a rigorous collection of experimental data and its logical  analysis. We don't gain our fisherman's certainty with  the  instantaneous flash of a mathematical proof. But still we know things.  I know, for instance, that a #20 Sparkle Dun works better than a Royal  Coachman during a Pale Morning Dun hatch. I know that a streamer works  better when it's overcast than when it's sunny. And I know too that  Wigglers can cause a fish to come such a tremendous distance to mount  an attack, I don't think vision alone can fully explain it. The answer,  I think, can be found in any introductory biology text, like the  following paragraph form *Life: "Fishes have a special sensory system  lacking in terrestrial vertebrates. This consists of a series of  grooves or canals with clusters of sensory cells on head and body, the  lateral line organs. They are sensitive to changes in pressure or  currents in the surrounding water." In other words, fish don't  necessarily have to see a wiggler to know it's there, because they can  sese it and feel it with their lateral line, even in muddy, off-color  water conditions.    
<br/><br/>

Do fish really attack a wiggling, vibrating fly in response to  pressure sensitive cues from their lateral line organs? I certainly  think so. How else can you explain vicious, determined strikes in  chocolate brown water? How else can you explain a brown trout who swims  20' across a current to lunge at a 2" wiggler? Of this I am certain:  lightweight fly rod wigglers elicit a strange magnetic response from  large predatory fish that's seldom triggered by any statically drifting  wet fly or streamer. Wiggler fishing, like gently rising trout during a  midday hatch, is an experience no adventurous fly fisherman should  never  miss.

<h1>Tuning</h1>    In order to fish with homemade wigglers, I've found I have to carry a  pair of toenail clippers in my vest, so I can tune my flies before  using them. Tuning doesn't take much, but it is a one-time-only step  that is usually necessary. Most new wigglers don't track in a straight  line; instead they wiggle off to one side, with increasing persistence  directly proportional to the force of the water that drags against the  bill. The solution is simple: for a fly that wiggles off to the left,  trim a small slice off the right side of the bill. And visa versa.    
<br/><br/>

<h1>Why they work, what's going on</h1>    What makes these wigglers work are the opposing forces of weight  and buoyancy. When the current pushes against the diving lip, the  entire fly becomes unstable. The bill tries to spin around sideways and  upward. Indeed an improperly balanced wiggler will do just that: turn  upside down and plane directly up to the surface. But a buoyant foam  body at the rear, combined with a slightly weighted diving lip at the  front can provide just enough torque on the fly to keep it oriented  downward, so the diving lip continually  shakes and vibrates back and  forth, without ever spinning completely upside down. In general, the  best side-to-side, slow motion wobblers are not the best divers.  Conversely the best divers usually have a narrow, high-speed flutter  rather than a wide action wobble. The greater the angle between the  body and the lip, the wider the wobble. The deepest, fast-action divers  have just enough angle between the lip and the fly body to catch the  current.

<h1>How to fish with wigglers</h1>    Fishing with wigglers isn't hard to master. Most of what you need  to know I've already explained. You can fish a neutrally buoyant  wiggler like any conventional streamer. Cast it out, let it drift,  strip it in. Even when a wiggler is drifting it will still have more  motion than any conventional streamer. Then, when you strip it back in,  you'll feel the rod tip throb as the wiggler darts and wobbles through  the currents. Take a look downstream. Try to identify the spots that  are hardest to fish to with any conventional technique. Swim a wiggler  downstream with a straight line, right into the bulge of slack water  immediately upstream of a mid river boulder. Hold it there for a moment  or two, and then swim it left and right. Fish downstream into a tangle  of branches or driftwood along the bank. If you see a fish swim up  behind a wobbling fly to casual sniff and see what's up: pull the fly  away at just the last moment, so it darts and wiggle away in a last  minute panic.    You can troll a wiggler behind a float tube, or splash the slack  water pockets along the bank while drifting by in a boat. On the Big  Horn or Missouri rivers in Montana, where the river is wide and shallow  and where the biggest fish ore often found along deep, undercut banks  below a long diagonal riffle, I like to pard a driftboat upstream with  a  heavy anchor and wade slowly downstream. I cas directly across , as  close to the bank as possible, drifting the wiggler downstream as it  will, slipping line out through my fingers as needed, swimming the fly  as close to the bank as possible.    Cutthroats from Yellowstone Park, brown trout along the banks of  the Missouri, rainbows on the spring creeks, brook trout form high  mountain lakes, channel catfish from the lower Yellowstone, Sauger and  Walleye from prairie rivers in central Montana: it's an impressive  list. Lightweight soft-bodied wigglers are the most versatile, most  universally attractive flies I know. This is big medicine.    Life, Lawcourt Brace and Company,  1957, GA. Simpson, Cas. , L.H.
