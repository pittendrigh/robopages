<b>How to make a diving wiggler</b><br/>
<b>Simple floating wobbling lures that don't really dive are easier</b><br/>
<b>Diving wigglers (Riffle Darts) are harder </b><br/>
<br/>
Here's the start of a small wiggler.  Cut some buoyant closed cell foam vaguely as per this drawing
Cut a diving bill from a clear plastic tomato container.  But the bill too big.  <br/>
<br/>
Rough the back end of the bill up with 100 grit sand paper.<br/>

Use super glue to fix the bill to the foam.<br/>
<br/>
Skewer the foam on a seing needle. Wrap the foam LOOSELY with thread, perhaps lashing down a trailing feather on top.<br/>
Color the foam as needed with a marking pen.<br/>
<br/>
Glue on some eyes if you want.<br/>
<br/>
Paint the foam with fabric cement.<br/>
<br/>
Poke a hole in the middle of the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Snell a hopper hook.  Put a bead on the tag end of the snell. Run the leader through a hole in the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Knot a barrel swivel as close to the bill as you can make it.<br/>
<br/>
Use toe nail clippers, at streamside, to tune the bill.  If the flure tracks left trim the lower right side of the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Skewer the hook through one of dimpling thread wraps on the body, so the hook stays aligned with the body.
<br/>
<br/>
Fish it downstream into a log jam.<br/>

<br/>
RE> bill tuning again. Learning how to make wigglers involves trial and error.  Wigglers with a slow wide wobble tend not to dive well. Wigglers with a high frequency vigration rather than a wobble tend to dive deeper.  The hole in the bill effects wobble significantly.  Lower down on the bill means a deeper dive.  Higher up makes a wider, slower wobble. How heavy the bead effects things too.  Diamond-shaped bills with a point at the lower end are easier to cast, and they work better in a current.
