If this isn't a fly it isn't a lure either. I unpacked a spin rod today and tried to cast this one in my driveway. It isn't heavy enough to go more than 20 feet beyond the spin rod tip.<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on wigglers for a long time. Lightweight divers with traditional U-shaped crank bait diving bills bite the water too aggressively for cold water river fishing, with or without a flyrod. A narrower diamond-shaped wiggle bill is easier to cast because it's less wind resistant and it works better in moving waters.<br/>
<br/>
One favorite wade with these guys is from the mouth of Beartrap Canyon on the Madison River in Montana down to the first boat ramp at the Warm Springs fishing access. It's shallow enough to wade the whole way, right down the middle of the river. Shallow enough if you're going with the flow. Most of it is waist deep as you go so you'd never make it from here to there against the current. You have to go with it. And there are no fishing boats there ever. There are often a few fishermen at the edges but the middle of the river is all yours. And almost never fished.<br/>
<br/>
Wading downstream while casting sideways and down, with a Riffle Dart, allows me to work every holding bucket in the river in two to three feet of water. There are more fish out at the edges. But the big gravel buckets between the weeds, right out in the middle of the river is where the bigger fish are.<br/>
<br/>
With a Riffle Dart I can fish downstream into deep water. Without a Dart the only way to fish deep is to cast upstream into water you just waded through, and then you have to wait while it sinks which puts the fly at fishing depth right next to you and a few feet out at best, in water where they're already spooked. Fishing 30 to 40 feet downstream into 3 feet of water is...powerful stuff.<br/>
<br/>
To do it that way you need a Riffle Dart. I fish these with a dry fly line and a looooooooooong 18 or 20 foot leader. Or with a sink tip line and an extra short leader.<br/>

You can make multiple holes in the diving bill. Higher up makes more wobble but less dive. Lower down on the bill makes less wobble but deeper, more aggressive diving.<br/>
<br/>
Tuning: if the flure tracks right, instead of straight ahead, use toe nail clippers to trim a sliver off the left side of the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Snip out the bill, with scissors. Rough up the top half of the bill with 100 grit sand paper. Skewer the foam onto a needle. Wet the bill with ZapAGap. Lash it onto the foam with a few loose wraps of thread.<br/>
<br/>
Don't rub your eyes or take a leak if you still have wet superglue on your fingers.<br/>
