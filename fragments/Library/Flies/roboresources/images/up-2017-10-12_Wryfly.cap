<h3> Wry Flies </h3> I can't see small dryflies anymore but I still like to tie them.  Sometimes I swing them like wet flies and wait for a tug. Other times I put them behind a Royal Wulff and look for dimples behind the big white fly.  I can't tell if they float or not but it doesn't seem to matter.
