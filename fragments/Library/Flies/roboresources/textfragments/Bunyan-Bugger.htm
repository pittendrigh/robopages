<h3>Springtime in the Mountains</h3>
The salmon fly hatch in Montana is an annual epidemic of spring
fever born of the first warm jubilant rays of sunshine after a long
cold mountain winter and a dark windy clammy and cold Montana spring.
<br/><br/>
The Salmon flies usually start hatching here in Montana, or in Idaho I
should say, in the box canyon of the Henry's Fork of the Snake at the
end of the first week in June. By the time they fizzle out on the
Henry's Fork a week or so later the big flies are already hatching on
the Big Hole at Twin Bridges or above. Times and conditions vary as much as a

week or two from year to year. But by the 20th of June the Big Hole
hatch has usually reached the old power house at Divide. And the really
bad craziness in the Maiden Rock Canyon will have reached its peak.
<br/><br/>
The Big Hole river is one the most beautiful drainages in north
America. It holds some of the biggest trout in the state and  it is
only about forty miles from Butte Montana--the hard working hard
partying home of Evel Kneivel and forty thousand other elk hunting
trout fishing hard rock miners and salt-of-the-earth urban cowboys.
When the sun is shining and the flies are are hatching on a  weekend in
June nearly half the populations of Butte, Dillon Ennis, Bozeman and
Helena plus a small army of adventurers from California, Texas,
Illinois, New York, New Jersey and a Massachusetts are hooting and
hollering and drifting down through the Maiden Rock Canyon in or on any
thing that stays afloat.
<br/><br/>

The best strategy, regardless where you plan to fish, is to get on
the river early. Camping and sleeping on the bank of the river
somewhere near your point of departure might seem like a good plan. But
getting any sleep anywhere within two miles of the Divide campground is
totally out of the question. Big fat tired four wheel drive pickups
with roll bars whip antennae and booming country-western tape decks
rumble into the campground all night pulling driftboats and racks of
river rafts. They circle through the campground with their bright
lights on searching endlessly for one last place to park while kids
scream hamburgers sizzle firecrackers bang and morocycles, trail
bikes and all terrain vehicles spin donuts and fly in and out of the
parking lot doing fourth of July wheel stands. When the first cowboy
jitterbuggers turn up their wilderness blasters and start dancing on
the picnic tables you might think a blimp full of laughing gas had
exploded over a rodeo: 
<br/>
"Cuz I'm a honky tonk maaaayan. EEEEEEEHHHHHHAAAAAaaaaaa! Hey there easy money, git me some beeeer! We
are gonna catch us some fish tomarrrow!"
<br/><br/>

This is springtime in the mountains. The revelry seldom lets up
until after two when they shut down the Blue Moon Saloon a mile or so
down the road. And even then, for another hour or two thereafter the
still chill mountain air will be violated by barking dogs and the rhythmic
squeak-swing-slam of the spring loaded outhouse doors. The campgrounds
down the road at Brown's Bridge and Glenn are little different. So
you're better off to take the old cutoff road to Twin Bridges and
pull out on the prairie somewhere to throw out a sleeping bag, somewhere in between the prickly pears.
<br/><br/>

The next best strategy to getting up earlier than everyone else is
to try and figure out where that elusive one or two mile slowly moving
section of the river is where the flies are just beginning to hatch,
where the fish aren't yet stuffed to the bursting point, and where the
frenzied pace of the fishing  is supposed to climax in  a reckless orgy
of slashing, snapping, swirling trout: the head of the hatch. Then,
once you've figured out the where the head of the hatch is, you have to
decide whether to fish upstream or downstream from the commotion,
because the head of the hatch is where eighty to ninety  percent of the
masses will be. One theory has it that the next three to ten miles
upstream of the head of  the hatch is the place  to be, because the
nymphs  will on the move there, instinctively moving into the shallows
in anticipation of the hatch. And the too will be the anxious trout,
lying hungrily in wait. Or so goes the theory.  If the upstream fishing
doesn't work, another strategy is to fish downstream from the hatch at
least ten miles and a day or two from the peak of the action. The trick
is to get downstream far enough because the fish will be bloated with
flies and absolutely impossible to catch for twenty-forty hours after
the hatch has passed on up the river. Perlidae, or golden stoneflies,
often hatch simultaneously with big Pteronarcys salmon flies and the
fish often seem to prefer the smaller golden stoneflies to the bigger
ones. This mysterious preference for the smaller stoneflies is
especially noticeable downstream from the head of the hatch.
<br/><br/>

Any serious angler should also be prepared to fish with streamers
during the salmon fly hatch.  I remember taking my boat out at Melrose
late one summer evening--sun burned and dog tired after three says of
guiding on the river--when I encountered my friend Wayne, who was
taking creel census number for the Montana Fish and  Game Department.
Wayne has a strong sense of mischief in his heart, and he was adding to
the general mayhem that evening by showing everybody a photograph of a
19lb female brown trout. The fish shocking crews had rolled this fish
out a  deep hole in the maiden rock canyon only a week before the
hatch. And Wayne was telling everybody, as he took their creel counts,
that a California fly fisherman had taken that fish on a sofa pillow
the day before yesterday.
<br/><br/>

I knew better however and threatened to turn him into the
authorities for inciting to riot if he didn't
give me the real scoop. So on a more serious note, Wayne said "Well
I'll tell you. The really good fishing has all been down below Brown's
bridge. The guides from the Complete Angler have been fishing Bou's
down there, and they took and eight pound 27" brown down the just last
night.  But watch out for that bridge! There isn't enough clearance to
get a boat under it, and there's been a dozen boats sunk down there in
the past three days!" 
<br/>
Bou's , which are e little more than red and
yellow marabou girdle bugs with long, multi colored tails are a long
established big Hole tradition.
<br/><br/>

Last but certainly not least, if you  want to joint the great
masses of fisherman at the head of the hatch you can fish either with
big black nymphs or adult dry fly salmon fly immitations--or both. The
action will be the thickest where ever there are willow bushes lining
the banks of the river, where small triangular shaped eddies of still
water--under the willow branches--are immediately adjacent to deep,
medium fast current.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Fishing Nymphs</h3>
The nymph fishing during the last two weeks leading up the salmon
fly hatch has consistently produced the best fly fishing for me over
the years.  If I had to choose (if I could choose)  I'd take the first
warm, cloudy  but not windy day after a cold snap--on the Big Hole--2
to 3 days before the (salmon) flies begin to hatch.  Well, if I could
choose, that would be my second choice, I guess, after a winning
powerball ticket. During that period, the  nymphs start migrating
toward the shallows. They must know how to recognize willow roots
somehow, because they congregate there in great masses,  clinging to
underwater willow roots in huge bunches like handfulls of
insectivorous grapes.
<br/><br/>

I like to fish two nymphs simultaneously.  Why not? If you do fish
two or more flies, you will always catch the most fish on the end fly.
But at the end of the day, if you have caught a half a dozen fish on
the second fly, well, those are bonus fish.  I don't like droppers,
so--to fish more than one nymph at a time--I attach the tippet attached
to  the end fly to the bend of the hook in front.  Use split shot and
fish a tight straight line, so you can feel the strikes.  Fish the
slack water at the tip ends of the  islands, where two currents come
together. Fish the drift lines at the edge of  any fast, deep run,
where the still water along the edge meets the swifter, often
un-fishable current of main river.  And never pass up an opportunity to
fish a riffle corner,  where a shallow, pebbly, boat bumping riffle
drains down into a deeper water.
<br/><br/>

Traditional nymphs include Bitch Creeks, Montana Nymphs, Woolly
Worms and anything else that looks like a 1-1/2" long black tube with
six thick, crooked black legs at the front end. I like Marshmallow
Nymphs the best.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Fishing Dry Flies</h3>
When fishing dry flies, don't be afraid to twitch your fly a
little. Adult salmon flies are out of short lived element in the water,
and they do flail around with a great commotion when the fall into the
river.  In fact I think twitching the fly is an important part of ate
adult salmon fly presentation. I like to make my salmon flies with foam
bodies and rubber legs. Ruibber legs exaggerate teh animated struggling
impresson of a drowing fly while the foam body keeps the whole thing
afloat, regarless how  water logged it becomes. Traditional flies
include Sofa Pillows, Bird's Stonefly, Stimulators. No one fishes
Bunyan Bugs anymore, except perhaps for me. Bunyan Bugs date back to
the turn of the century here in Montana...perhaps even earlier. Bunyan
bugs are small wooden plugs, outfitted with horse hair wings and hand
painted bodies. It was on a Bunyan Bug that Brad Pit caught his huge
(hatchery) fish in "A River Runs Through It."  I had the Bunyan Bug in
mind when I devised the foam bodies Bunyan Bug.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Fishing Both</h3>
The most deadly technique of all, during the peak of the hatch,
especially in the Big Hole, is to float the river in a boat, sharing
duty on the oars with someone who knows the river and knows how to row,
while fishing dry flies and nymphs simultaneously,...where the dry fly
adult serves as a strike indicator (that catches fish)  for one or more
large pteronarcys nymph. The only way to make this approach practicle
is make the dry fly adult imitation out of closed cell foam, so it has
enough bouyancy to stay afloat, even in fast water, even when attached
to one or two large, moderately weighted, succulent stonefly nymphs.
