<h1> Wetflies </h1>
Wet flies are a big category. For the most part I think about soft hackle wet flies, hair hackle wet flies and traditional English Gentleman-style winged wet flies. Nymphs are wet flies too and it's convenient to separate that way.  But the boundaries are vague and hard to define.
