I found this Pop Lip (Bob Popovics) link on youtube. Pretty cool. I will have to work with this, with shaping flure bodies and flure lips with silicone seal, with fingers wetted with Photo Flow and/or Windex.

What this guy is making is close to a floating still water fly that dives only an inch or two and wiggles nicely--in still water--when retrieved. I know from experience this fly will turn over upside down and plane right up to the surface if used against a medium speed or faster current.

But it wouldn't take much to fix that. The hair body of this fly could surround a small amount of closed-cell foam in order to provide buoyancy at the top-back-end of the body, while weight could be added to the back side of the planing bill by burying a tungsten bead under a bit more silicone.

That two part addition of buoyancy at the top back working against weight at the bottom front keeps the fly from flipping over a lot longer. If you use enough weight to go beyond the buoyancy of the closed cell foam then you have a flure that sinks at rest. Which means you can troll it downstream from the front of a drift boat, much the same way Pacific Northwest Coast guys troll plugs into deep water--a practice often called "pulling plugs."

Pulling plugs requires a properly balanced lure and a fisherman who knows how to manage the rod and a rower who knows how to slow the boat down in all the right places, so the plug catches the current and dives deeply. Sometimes really deeply. That may not be particularly useful to bass fishermen but it's often just what the doctor ordered when chasing migrating salmonids. Or for river-run walleyes or channel catfish.

You can do that with a spin or casting rod and a heavy plug. But you can also do it with a relatively light weight fly flure too. If you build it the right way.
