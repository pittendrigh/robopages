<h1>This <b>Flies</b> directory is presented in book format</h1>  
...as specified by conf/dirlayouts.ini

<br/><br/>
Any and all previous work on dislaying epub3 on the server has
been abandoned in favor of this dynamic HTML book-like version.
<br/><br/>
This too is development code only, as of 03/20/2020.  But it already works more reliably than the previous epub3 display.
<br/><br/>
These codes display a table of contents showing all top-level book chapters, with arbitrary file-system directory/folder nesting below that, where local chapter-level links are added depending on which chapter is currently being viewed.

<br/><br/>
All this depends upon the existance of a Library/MybookName/p2n file, which can be generated with commandLineUtils/tocit.py
Once generated by tocit.py manual vi edits are fine.  tocit.py will preserve any manually edits.
<br/><br/>
The p2n file provides page by page sequencing for the Next and Previous page buttons in the TOC
