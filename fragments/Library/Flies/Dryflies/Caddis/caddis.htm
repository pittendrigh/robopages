<h1> Paraducks Caddis </h1>
Everything I said in the last chapter about mayflies is basically deja-vu all over again for dry fly Caddis. The standard Western Mayfly is Al Troth's Elk Hair Caddis.  It's a great flyEverything I said in the last chapter about mayflies is basically deja-vu all over again for dry fly Caddis. The standard Western Mayfly is Al Troth's Elk Hair Caddis.  The Elk Hair is the world's heavy weight champion caddis imitation and what I have won't change.

One of the best things about Al's Elk Hair Caddis, is that it's easy to see on the water. So aha. There again is yet one more dry fly criterion. We need cheap, easy, quick to tie, floats well, dries off quickly and we need easy to see. Damn. Because easy to see is the a bit of a problem with what I tie the mnost--my Paraducks Caddis.  There is a work around however, that makes the Paraducks easy to see. But first things first.
<br/><br/>
But there is a niche for a new pattern, other than the Elk Hair Caddis. And for me the Paraducks is it. Don't get me wrong. I love the Elk Hair Caddis. I've watched Al Troth tie it too, both back at his home in Dillon and at the old Troutfitter's Fly Shop in Bozeman, where Al came to to tie in March, for many years.

It's hard to find fault with the Elk Hair Caddis.  It's one of the best fish-catching dry flies ever invented. The one fly in the ointment for me is tyhing time.  Al's fly has a dubbed body oved-wrapped with a high-quality rooster feather Palmer Hackle and then over-wrapped yet again with gold wire.

The best thing about the Paraducks Caddis is that it's mine, which means I get extra pleasure in tying it. So by god there it is. Yet one more good fly criterion.  Now we have cheap, easy, quick to tie, floats well, dries off quickly and we need easy to see. And fun to tie, which is an entirely subjective response with infinite variability.

The Paraducks is generic idea applicable to all dry fly Caddis.  Use a scud hook. Make a flat, caddis-like down-wing with a tuft of duck flank, tied on the same way Al did with his elk hair wing. And now add a simple Snow Shoe Rabbit or Zelon or carpet-scraps right hackle on the bottom of the fly. And boom. You're done.

Like a real Caddis the Paraducks Caddis sits flat and close the surface of the water.  So to fish that hard-to-see short-coming, on top of the duck flank down wing I almost always add a bit of bright white Zelon or carpet scrap. Or sometimes even a bit of fluorescent orange synthetic what ever, like ....
<br/><br/>
Now it's even easy to see. And they do fall off the vise a lot quicker than the old Elk Hair Caddis.  I tie them both. Al is or was my favorite tier of all time. And the Elk Hair Caddis was probably his best fly. The Paraducks is one my best flies.
