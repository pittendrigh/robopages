<h1> Dry Flies </h1>

Fly fishing for me and my dad started on the West Fork of the Bitterroot in 1961 or so when we--me my parents and my cousin Jon--spent the summer there in a cabin only a few yards from the water.  My dad was writing a book but he fished a lot too.  Jon and I fished every day from early-June until we left three months later. I've never been quite the same ever since.
<br/><br/>
As a twelve year old I had fished a lot already, albeit with a warm-water spinning rod. In New Jersey.  My dad had never fished at all. His friend and colleague at the virus labratory in nearby Hamilton, Bill Hoyer, taught us everything he knew. Like a lot of fly fishermen in the those days Bill didn't fish before or during runnoff.  And he only fished with dry flies.

So when I finally got back to Montana 15 years later, with my pickup truck wife daughter dog and $300 dollars cash in my wallet I thought I had it covered. I was good with a hammer and I knew how to fish. This going to be blast.
<br/><br/>
It didn't take long to learn I only knew how to fish in summer. With dry flies like the Royal Wulff and Joe's Hopper. It's been a long journey since then.  
<br/><br/>
Fishing (frothing?) the water with big high-floating dry flies is still a blast and it's still even now just as good as it ever was. How much there is to say about it isn't clear. Among those who fish the big rivers in summer with big dry flies, particularly those casting from a moving boat, it is interesting how many spend the whole day 50 feet from the back pitching flies at pockets and drift lines along the bank.

..........every river different but .......... after the early summer water starts to drop...deep fast water in the middle is better.
