<h1 class="flexy"> Spring Creeks and Tailwaters </h1>
Fly tying and fly fishing was all about mayflies when I first started. The three books I had as a twelve year old where Paul Needham's <b>Trout Streams</b> and Vincent Marinaro's <b>Modern Dry Fly Code</b>  and Helen Shaw's <b>Fly Tying.</b> Most of Shaw's  how-to-do-it dressings were mayfly inspired. Needham's trout stomach surveys showed Caddis were an important trout food source that sill paled by comparison to mayflies <sup><b><i>1</i></b></sup>. ayflies were the main attraction. I could tell. A year or two later when my dad gave me a copy of <b>Matching the Hatch</b> I knew it for sure. Not much mattered other than mayflies. Or so it seemed. <br/>
<br/>
Fishing fly tying and lure making did turn out to be a bit richer than that first impression. But parts of it have stuck with me.  Like bacon and eggs sticking to the ribs, I still like tying mayfly dryflies the most. Now that I'm old and half blind and can't really see mayfly dry flies on the water any more I don't even fish them that much anymore.  When I do it's usually as a trailer behind a big #12 Royal Wulff I can see.  
<br/><br/>
When I first moved to Montana permanently, as a 27 year old carpenter with a young family, I didn't get to fish as much as I wanted the first few years. And when I did I found it frustrating. All I knew how to fish dry flies in July and August and not much else. And when July did come around I was nearly always too busy working.  My skills and a more relaxed life style did gradually evolve, as the years passed by. But what I thought I knew about dry fly fishing, not counting grass hoppers, evolved considerably.

<br/>
During the early 1990s, while struggling through college as a late-in-life college student, I spent several years guiding on Montana's Paradise Valley Spring creeks (DePuy's, O'Hairs and Nelson's Spring Creeks) <sup><b><i>1</i></b></sup>. My experiences there changed things considerably.  During a Pale Morning Dun hatch an aspiring new fly fishermen cannot expect to do well fishing a #12 Royal Wulff.  But almost anything dry or wet, of vaguely the right size and color will catch fish equally well.  I've seen #16 to #18 soft hackle wet flies knock the lights out.  Small traditionally-proportioned Catskill dressings work too. As do Compara Duns Parachute patterns.<br/>
<br/>
When I worked as a Spring Creek guide out of the Yellowstone Angler in the early 1990s, as a 40 year old college student, the other guides there all took me under their instructional wings and taught me the ropes.  The first thing they all said, about the spring creeks, was to change flies a lot. If a fussy fish refused (your client's) current offering, change flies.  "It doesn't matter what you change to," they all said. "Just change flies."  It worked too.  To be a successful spring creek fisherman you need to know the general routine about what flies to use when, and you need to learn the holding water, feeding runs, riffles weed bed lines.  And you need to learn about different behaviors at different times of day and different times of year.  And you also need to change flies a lot.  At least if what ever you are fishing with gets refused by and actively feedding fish.<br/>
<br/>
That's an interesting idea when you think about it.  Decades, no centuries of fly fishing authors and fly designers have speculated about what the best myfly design should look like, when from many a guide's perspective there is no such thing. When the best fly anything you might find in your box, of vaguely the right size and color, as long as it's different than what you've got tied on now.<br/>
<br/>
In that context other measures of value quickly rise to the top.  Good dry flies, if it really doesn't much what they look like, need to float well, dry off quickly, cast well and for me perhaps most of all, they need to be quick and easy to tie. I want my mayflies to look like the real thing too, even if it doesn't matter that much to the fish.  It does to me.   
<br/> <br/>
So how do we do that?  Western tailwater fisheries and spring creek guides tend to like flat, low-to-water dry fly profiles for mayfly imitations like Parachute flies, Comparaduns Puff-wings and no-hackles rather than Eastern Catskill patterns.  Me too, in general, because the Catskill pattens are harder to tie, they don't work any better and because good rooster feathers are expensive. So. Aha.  There's another best fly criterion: cheaper is better than expensive.
<br/> <br/>
I like to take it a step further. I like to have my cake and to eat it too.  For me the best mayfly imitation is the Ducktail Right Hackle. I fish it with confidence because it catches fish with the best of them.  And it is all those things mentioned above: float well casts well too, along with quick and easy to tie. And cheap too for that matter.
<br/> <br/>
I'll take a Ducktail off and tie on something else if it gets refused. But the Ducktail is always (always) where I start, if the mayflies are hatching and if dry flies are what I want to fish right now.
