Retrieve the current scroll position, you can use:

window.pageYOffset

Store the position, this has two parts, when and where:

You can chose to store the data, when the window closes, or every time the user scrolls, or on a set interval...

for the "where", depending on your app, you may want to store it, in a cookie, local-storage, on the server-side (if the user needs to log in to read the eBook)...

Restore the position when the user returns by retrieving the stored data, and scroll to that position using

window.scrollTo(0, position);
