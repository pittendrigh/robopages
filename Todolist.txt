1) All domains on a server run from common robopages code
This is an easy change but it does make installation a bit less lickedy split
for beginners. So, leave it the way it is. Describe a procedure, or perhaps a script,
for installing in a more library like way, so all domains on a dedicated server vary only by layouts and css.

2) two css files where foretround/background/border colors are separate

3) Server side page caching? Why? It's fast now.

4) Docroot belongs to the server process instead of me, but is not writable, except for LOGS directories,
and except for thumbnail maintence, which switches to writable with chmod.
