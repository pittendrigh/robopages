On servers controlled by me I like to make the DOCUMENT_ROOT 
chmod -R 0644 (except perhaps LOG file directories) and chmod -R me.me

Then the webserver process does not have write permission to what's under
the DOCUMENT_ROOT

This does mean all site maintenance must be done with scp and ssh bash sed and perl.
Those are skills beyond the abilities of many who just want to have a website.

Unskilled users will have to (somehow) make thumbnails on the Desktop and then copy
them up to the server, into .../path/path/path/roboresources/thumbs

If path/path/path/roboresources/thumbs doesn't exist the first step would be to
make that path, on the Desktop. Then make the thumbs. Then use ftp or scp to copy it
all up to the server.

File maintenance for skilled users is a bit more straightforward.
Copy html fragment files and/or images up to the server.

Create any needed directory paths under /path/path/document_root/fragments/path/path/
cd path/path/fragments/path/whereever/

Copy relevant files to 
To make thumbnails put the commandLineUtils/mkslides to ~/bin on the server
cd to /path/path/document_root/fragments/path/path/
type `mslides <enter>`

Now navigation links generated by plugins/dynamicNavigation.php 	
will show clickable thumbnails instead of simple text links.
